Hey <%= @name %> ,
you will perhaps wonder why in the last email an account for Textseed was hidden for you.


Textseed is a more organic way to write your documents! Let your documents and thoughts grow through other's people's contributions, just as flowers grow when receiving sun and water.
We offer a service for friends and partners who want to work on one single document for school or business.
It's also a tool for sharing your thoughts and texts with others. Because everybody can participate it can help getting new inspiration by letting the document grow in an more organic way. 


The user <%= @invitor %>   has invited you to participate in the document <%= @project %>. 
The projects description:
<%= @projectdesc %>


After you activate your account in the last email, you can participate directly without any detours!
The project can be found under  <%= @url%>. You'll find it, however, in your listings of projects.


Have fun with Textseed!
Greetings from your Textseed team
